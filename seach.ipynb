      "communications since it can generate high-gain directional beams with low-cost\n",
      "phase shifters via low-complexity beam training. However, conventional\n",
      "beamforming codebook design based on array response vectors for narrowband\n",
      "communications may suffer from severe performance loss in wideband systems due\n",
      "to the ``beam squint\" effect over frequency. To tackle this issue, we propose\n",
      "in this paper a new codebook design method for analog beamforming in wideband\n",
      "THz systems. In particular, to characterize the analog beamforming performance\n",
      "in wideband systems, we propose a new metric termed wideband beam gain, which\n",
      "is given by the minimum beamforming gain over the entire frequency band given a\n",
      "target angle. Based on this metric, a wideband analog beamforming codebook\n",
      "design problem is formulated for optimally balancing the beamforming gains in\n",
      "both the spatial and frequency domains, and the performance loss of\n",
      "conventional narrowband beamforming in wideband systems is analyzed. To solve\n",
      "the new wideband beamforming codebook design problem, we divide the spatial\n",
      "domain into orthogonal angular zones each associated with one beam, thereby\n",
      "decoupling the codebook design into a zone division sub-problem and a set of\n",
      "beamforming optimization sub-problems each for one zone. For the zone division\n",
      "sub-problem, we propose a bisection method to obtain the optimal boundaries for\n",
